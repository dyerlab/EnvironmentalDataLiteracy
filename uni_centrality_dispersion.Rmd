> In this secion we close out the exploring data section by defining measures of central tendency, dispersion, and explore a few ways to ordinate data.


For these data, we will use the `iris` data set as an example.  This data set is built into `R` and is has the quantitative measurements for Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Length, and Petal Width for 150 samples taken from individuals in three different species of *Iris*.

```{r uni_centrality_dispersion}
summary(iris)
```


## Central Tendency

Central tendency is a term we use to define the *center of gravity* of some data.  There are several measures of central tendency that we commonly use.  In `R`, only the arithmetic mean is included by default, to estimate the remaining ones, we can install the `DescTools` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("DescTools")
```

Once installed, we need to load it into memory.

```{r }
library(DescTools)
```

and we are ready to go.

*Arithmetic Mean* - The arithmetic mean is the 'average' that we use on the common vernacular and is defined as:

\[
\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i
\]

In `R` we estimate it using the `mean()` function.

```{r}
mean( iris$Sepal.Width )
```

We can apply this across groupings in our data using the `by()` function (as we've done previously) to measure the mean of measurements across groups of observations.

```{r}
by( iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, mean )
```

*Geometric Mean* - The arithmetic mean is not the only way to measure the center of gravity of your data.  The geometric mean is defined as the $n^{th}$ root of the product of measurements.

\[
\mu_{g} = \left( \prod_{i=1}^N x_i \right)^{\frac{1}{N}}
\]

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DescTools)
Gmean(iris$Sepal.Width )
```


The geometric mean is often used to compare values that are multiples or exponential.  For example, in the *Iris* data, it may be more appropriate to evaluate differences in sepal area using the geometric mean rather than the arithmetic one.

```{r}
by( iris$Sepal.Width*iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, Gmean )
```


*Harmonic Mean* - The harmonic mean is an approach commonly applied to fractional data (percentages) or data that has outliers.  It is estimated as the recipricol of the arithmetic mean of reciprocals...

\[
\mu_{h} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{N} \left( \frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_N} \right)}
\]

The effects of outliers can be seen in the example:

```{r}
x <- c(2,3,5,6,100)
mean(x)
Hmean(x)
```

In our iris data, we can apply the `Hmean` as before across species

```{r}
by( iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, Hmean )
```

*Median* - The median is the center of the data, the value where half of the observations are larger and half are smaller---the 50$^{th}$ quantile.

```{r}
median( iris$Sepal.Width )
by( iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, median )
```

This is a rank-based measure of central tendency and one that we saw in the Normality discussion last week.

## Dispersion

In addition to the central tendency, for us to describe the data, we also need to know a bit about the dispersion of values around the center of gravity.  

*Range* - The range is the physical separation between the smallest and largest values.

```{r}
range( iris$Sepal.Width )
by( iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, range )
```

It is identical to:

```{r}
c( min(iris$Sepal.Width), max( iris$Sepal.Width))
```


*Sample Variance* - The variance of the data, $\sigma^2$, is defined as the average distance between the observations and the arithmetic mean of the observations.  It is not quite the 'average' since we need to punish ourselves for estimation the mean as we've lost a *degree of freedom*.  We will come back to this later in a more detailed way, just take it on faith right now.  The idealized formula is:

\[
s^2 = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2
\]

which you should never use when using a computer to estimate the sample variance.  There are some significant problems with round-off error that cause this theoretical formula to produce incorrect results.  

In `R` we estimate the variance as:

```{r}
var( iris$Sepal.Width )
```

and can be applied across groups as:

```{r}
by( iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, var)
```

where we can see that *I. setosa* has more variation in sepal width than the other species.  



*Standard Deviation* - The units on the variance are not same as the units for the original data, since it is the deviance squared.  To interpret the dispersion in a way that is comparable, we take the square root of the variance - a term called the standard deviation.  And while it has its own formula

```{r}
sd( iris$Sepal.Width)
```

it is identical to

```{r}
sqrt( var( iris$Sepal.Width))
```

It is common to use the standard deviation to designate some spread of the data around the mean using error bars.  Here is an example using the `barplot()` and `arrows()` functions (*n.b.* I return the value of the x-coordinates from the bar plot function to use in the arrows function).

```{r}
mu <- by( iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, mean )
b <- barplot(mu, ylim=c(0,4))
sepal.sd <- by( iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Species, sd )
x <- b
y0 <- as.numeric( mu )
y1 <- y0 + as.numeric( sepal.sd)
arrows( x,y0,x,y1, angle = 90 )
```
