## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)

Learning objectives may be applied at several heirarchical levels within this course.  Overall, the course has specific objectives that are a *de facto* statement of what you should expect to get from the content of this class.  If you look to your individual degree Program Learning Outcomes, you should see how these course-level objectives map directly onto those outcomes.

Let's start with a definition.  In this text, all definitions will be styled as follows:

## Learning Objective
Learning Objectives are explicit statements that define the knowledge, skills, and abilities you will demonstrate upon successful completion of this course. All assessments are designed to directly measure your achievement of these objectives, ensuring alignment between what you practice, what you're evaluated on, and what you ultimately master.

This course has the following Course Learning Objectives (CLOs):

## Course Modules

This course is partitioned into the following four self-contained, though sequential, learning modules.

### Module 1: The R Ecosystem

> Establishing the technical foundation for quantitative analysis in population genetics. Students will master R programming fundamentals, data visualization using the grammar of graphics, and reproducible scientific documentation. These skills are prerequisite for all subsequent evolutionary analyses.

*Module Bloom Spread[^1]:* ~3.8-4.0

Analogy Summary:
: The process of learning these foundational skills is like learning to prepare a sophisticated meal. MLO1 teaches you ingredient preparation—correctly identifying your ingredients (data types), organizing them into appropriate containers (data frames/lists), and cleaning or transforming them (Tidyverse verbs) before cooking can begin. MLO2 focuses on presentation—using the "Grammar of Graphics" (rules of plating) to ensure the final dish is attractive and conveys information effectively. MLO3 combines everything into the recipe and plating—documenting every step (code chunks) and integrating narrative (text), results (inline R output), tables, and presentation (visualizations) into a final, shareable, verifiable format (Quarto document). Just as a chef must master ingredients, presentation, and documentation to create reproducible haute cuisine, you must master these three objectives to produce professional, reproducible data analysis.

[^1]: Bloom spread is metric that quantifies cognitive complexity in course design by aggregating Bloom's taxonomy classifications from individual assessments through learning objectives to course outcomes. This framework enables temporal analysis of cognitive demand progression across a semester, revealing developmental arcs rather than simple linear progression.  See [here](BloomSpread.qmd) for an overview of this metric.
